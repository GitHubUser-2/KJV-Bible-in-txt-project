# KJV Bible in txt
Hello, and thank you for visiting this page! As the title says above, this is the full King James Version Bible.  
Actually, it isn't the full Bible quite yet. We have to type out each individual chapter, verse by verse.  
That's why we need your help!  
\
The way you help is by reading what is in here, comparing it to an authentic KJV Bible as you go.  
If you find a typo, misplaced or misnamed chapter, or worse, a fake text (***really*** bad), you can  
submit an Issue, and we will try to fix it!
