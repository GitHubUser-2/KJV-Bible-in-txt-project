# KJV Bible in txt
## A work in progress
Hello, and thank you for visiting this page! As the title says above, this is the full King James Version Bible.\
Actually, it isn't the full Bible quite yet. We have to type out each individual chapter, verse by verse.\
That's why we need your help!
There are two ways you can help contribute to this project:
### 1.
You can help type out and submit chapters. That would really help the development along!
### 2.
You can read the chapters in this repository, and put in an issue report on such things as typos,\
inaccuracy, and false text (we ***especially*** do not want that!).\
That way the contributors can quickly locate problems and fix them.
